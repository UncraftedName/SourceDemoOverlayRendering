# SourceDemoOverlayRendering
WIP

A program for rendering player positions over images of levels using Source demos. 
Currently this will only work from a top down perspective and will only display the locations of player 1 from the demo.
Eventually I will add real instructions on how to use this as well as gifs showcasing what this do. For now you get a bunch of text :p.
