# SourceDemoOverlayRendering
WIP

A program for rendering player positions over images of levels using Source demos. 
Currently this will only work from a top down perspective and will only display the locations of player 1 from the demo.
Eventually I will add real instructions on how to use this as well as gifs showcasing what this do. For now you get a bunch of text :p.

To run this you will need Java 11, (I think, idk how java versions work anymore) and processing (v. 3.5.3).
That can be found here: https://processing.org/download/
